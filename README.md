# GGUF Merge
As known, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) splits large files. This program, on the other hand, merge all split files back into a single, large file.

## Description

**GGUF Merge** is a C# project built with Visual Studio specifically designed for merging '.gguf-split-' files into a unified '.gguf' file. This project requires [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

## Example Usage

Assuming your executable is named `GGUF Merge.exe` and you have a 'gguf-split-' file named `goliath-120b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a`, you can use the following command in the command prompt (cmd):

```bash
"GGUF Merge.exe" leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a
```
Executing this command initiates the GGUF Merge application, instructing the program to identify all files sharing both the identical name and the '.gguf-split-' extension. Subsequently, the application merges these identified files, unifying them into a singular '.gguf' file.

In essence, the provided command orchestrates the amalgamation of all 'gguf-split-' files into a cohesive '.gguf' file.
