# GGUF Merge
As known, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) splits large files. This program, on the other hand, merge all split files back into a single, large file.

## Description

**GGUF Merge** is a C# project built with Visual Studio specifically designed for merging '.gguf-split-' files into a unified '.gguf' file. This project requires [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

## Usage

### Method 1: Drag and Drop

1. Open File Explorer and locate any 'gguf-split-' file you want to merge.
2. Drag the selected 'gguf-split-' file onto the program's executable file and wait for the process to complete.

### Method 2: Command Line Usage (CMD)

1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program's executable file.
3. Run the program with the specified 'gguf-split-' file as a command line argument. For example:
    ```bash
    "GGUF Merge.exe" path_to_file
    ```
4. Wait for the process to complete.

### Method 3: Simple Program Launch

1. Double-click the program's executable file to launch it.
2. The program will prompt you to specify the path to the 'gguf-split-' file.
3. Enter the path to the 'gguf-split-' file and wait for the process to complete.

## Example Usage

Assuming your executable is named `GGUF Merge.exe` and you have a 'gguf-split-' file named `leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a`, you can use the following command in the CMD:

```bash
"GGUF Merge.exe" leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a
```
Executing this command initiates the GGUF Merge application, instructing the program to identify all files sharing both the identical name and the '.gguf-split-' extension. Subsequently, the application merges these identified files, unifying them into a singular '.gguf' file.

In essence, the provided command orchestrates the amalgamation of all 'gguf-split-' files into a cohesive '.gguf' file.
