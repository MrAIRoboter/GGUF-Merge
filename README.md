# GGUF Merge

As known, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) splits large files. This program, on the other hand, merges all split files back into a single, large file.

## Description

**GGUF Merge** is a C# project built with Visual Studio specifically designed for merging `.gguf-split-` files into a unified `.gguf` file. This project requires [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

## Usage

### Method 1: Drag and Drop (Windows Only)

1. Open File Explorer and locate any `.gguf-split-` file you want to merge.
2. Drag the selected `.gguf-split-` file onto the program's executable file and wait for the process to complete.

### Method 2: Command Line Usage (CMD or Terminal)

#### Windows:
1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program's executable file.
3. Run the program with the specified `.gguf-split-` file as a command-line argument. For example:
    ```bash
    "GGUF Merge.exe" path_to_file
    ```
4. Wait for the process to complete.

#### Linux:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program’s `.dll` file.
3. Ensure that .NET 8 is installed (see the Linux guide below).
4. Run the program using:
    ```bash
    dotnet "GGUF Merge.dll" path_to_file
    ```
5. Wait for the process to complete.

### Method 3: Simple Program Launch (Interactive Mode)

1. Double-click the program’s executable file to launch it (Windows) or run it via `dotnet` (Linux).
2. The program will prompt you to specify the path to the `.gguf-split-` file.
3. Enter the path to the `.gguf-split-` file and wait for the process to complete.

## Example Usage

Assuming your executable is named `GGUF Merge.exe` (Windows) or `GGUF Merge.dll` (Linux), and you have a `.gguf-split-` file named `leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a`, you can use the following command:

### Windows:
```bash
"GGUF Merge.exe" leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a
```

### Linux:
```bash
dotnet "GGUF Merge.dll" leviathan-720b.Q5_K_M.gguf-split-a
```

Executing this command initiates the GGUF Merge application, instructing the program to identify all files sharing both the identical name and the `.gguf-split-` extension. Subsequently, the application merges these identified files, unifying them into a singular `.gguf` file.

## Running on Linux

### Installing .NET 8 on Linux

Before running the program on Linux, you must install .NET 8. The installation steps depend on your Linux distribution.

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

#### Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

#### Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

After installation, verify the installation:
```bash
dotnet --version
```
It should output a version `8.x.x`.

### Running the Program
Once .NET 8 is installed, navigate to the directory where `GGUF Merge.dll` is located and run:
```bash
dotnet "GGUF Merge.dll" path_to_file
```
This will merge all `.gguf-split-` files back into a single `.gguf` file.

## Notes
- Windows users can use the `.exe` directly.
- Linux users must run the `.dll` with `dotnet`.
- Ensure all `.gguf-split-` parts are in the same directory before running the program.
